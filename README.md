# Inspect-Wireframe
This is my first OpenGL project using GLFW, and its primary goal is to explore and inspect the wireframe representations of 3D objects. By focusing on wireframe visualization, this project serves as a foundation for understanding OpenGL rendering techniques and gaining hands-on experience with graphical programming concepts.
