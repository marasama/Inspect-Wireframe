# Wireframe Landscape Visualizer
A minimalist yet functional landscape visualizer that renders a dynamic 3D terrain using wireframes. The visualization avoids textures and unnecessary graphical elements, focusing purely on clean, geometric wireframe aesthetics. The landscape changes dynamically, offering smooth animations to simulate natural terrain features like hills, valleys, and plateaus. This project is ideal for showcasing terrain modeling or creating a visually engaging backdrop without the distraction of surface details.
